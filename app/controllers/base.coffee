# Controller baseclass
class Controller
	###
	The server-side controller is a helper class to provides handlers
	for the Express app routes. These routines mainly concern getting the 
	server-side template data and making the call to res.render.

	The important controller of the UI is client-side, so this can deal 
	with less dynamic things. Configuratin is currently done in config/routes.

	TODO: look into metadata based MVC. Would need some schema framework 
			for models elsewhere, and deal with Controller-View here.
