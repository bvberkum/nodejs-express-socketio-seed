# Controller baseclass
class Controller
  ###
  The server-side controller is a helper class to provides handlers
  for the Express app routes. These routines mainly concern getting the 
  server-side template data and making the call to res.render.

  The important controller of the UI is client-side, so this can deal with less dynamic things.
