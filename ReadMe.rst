NodeJS Socket.IO Seed
=====================
Seed project for NodeJS+Express.

Working
  - Basic structure and configuration for extendible Express app.
    No specs are written except the running code w/ comments.

Wanted
  - View-Controller metadata TODO: spec
  - Schema metadata, migration, validation at structure and datatype level.

See below for details, and `Branch docs`_ for work in process.

:FIXME: set-up master again to something without experiments
:XXX: After x-nodejs-socketio-ng-seed-mpe, started new repo for clean set-up. Should finally ditch that.
:TODO: angular client integration either goes or does something together with express-client
:TODO: loose the src/dotmpe too, move stuff to lib/
:XXX: there aren't any tests

Tree docs

      - bootstrap for Express. 
        Beginning of some Express-MVC framwork
        with other modules in dotmpe/

    dotmpe/x-bookmarks
      - re-using some old code to test Express-MVC
        see also project:node-htdocs

Branch docs
-----------
master

    - Going to dust off my own Du stylesheets and get bootstrap components and
      layout into the picture.

  f_clientbuild [*]_
    - Testing Grunt or Delinting.
    - Found r.js optimizer a bit tempramental. So using require.js
      at client side only.
    - Removed modulr, but may want to do lazy eval later again.
    - Started jade-requirejs-client to experiment with metadata driven pages,
      and to think some about resource representations and navigation.
    - TODO: stylus compiler.

  f_ext
    - Get an extension framework going at the backend with plugin modules.

  f_orm
    - Added Knex ORM, and WarehouseJS for Backbone REST access to ORM.
    - Play with backbone client. Look at MarionetteJS maybe.

  feature
    - Merging all features with exmaple modules here.
      To keep master clean. Should hand-pick generic changes to master.
